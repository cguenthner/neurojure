# Neurojure

Neurojure is a Clojure library for building, training, and testing neural network models using established
architectures and optimization techniques. It uses [Ranvier](https://github.com/cguenthner/ranvier) for
optimization and [Tensure](https://github.com/cguenthner/tensure) for tensor computations.

Neurojure provides functions for implementing the following techniques:

- _Deep feedforward networks_
- _Convolutional networks_ - the `conv2d` layer works on datasets of two spatial dimensions (width x height x
  channel)
- _Recurrent networks_ - the `recurrent` and `gru` (gated recurrent unit) layers can be used to build deep
  recurrent networks
- _Initialization_ - parameters can be initialized randomly over a variety of distributions
- _Regularization_ - indvidual layers support options for regularization. Pass the final cost through the
  `regularize` layer during training to actually apply regularization. There is also a `dropout` layer.
- _Common non-linearity and loss functions_
- _Encoding utilities_ - [neurojure.senses](https://cguenthner.github.io/neurojure/docs/neurojure.senses.html)
  has some utilities for preparing datasets for use in training networks--e.g. for fetching and caching
  datasets from the web, working with image data, generating one-hot encodings, tokenizing text, using word
  embeddings, _etc._
- _Robust optimization methods_ - With [Ranvier](https://github.com/cguenthner/ranvier), Neurojure networks
  can be trained using basic gradient descent and popular varients--gradient descent with momentum, RMSProp,
  and Adam

Neurojure is currently useful for many applications, including research of novel architectures and training of
small to medium-size networks. There are plans to extend its functionality to support a wider range of
scenarios, including training of large networks and datasets in a distributed environment.

## Getting Started

Add Neurojure to your dependencies. If using leiningen, add the following to your `:dependencies` in
`project.clj`:

```
[neurojure "0.0.1"]
```

and require the `core` namespace:

```
(require '[neurojure.core :as nn])
```

## Usage

The following snippet shows how to train a neurojure model to fit the xor function:

```
(require '[neurojure.core :as nn]
         '[ranvier.core :as r :refer [G]])

(r/set-rng-seed! 0)
(def naive-model
  (nn/make-model
    ; Models can contain named datasets; `:training`, `:dev`, and `:test` are common dataset names and are
    ; the defaults used by some functions. Here we include only one dataset, `:xor`, with three inputs,
    : `:a`, `:b`, and `:y`.
    :data {:xor {:a [1 1 0 0]
                 :b [1 0 1 0]
                 :y [0 1 1 0]}}
    ; This graph represents a very simple three-neuron network with logistic non-linearities for computing
    ; the xor function.
    :graph (G (-> (join-along 1
                              (reshape :a [4 1])
                              (reshape :b [4 1]))
                  (nn/dense {:units 2})
                  nn/logistic
                  (nn/dense {:units 1})
                  ; This will report the accuracy of our results during optimization.
                  (report (reshape :y [4 1])
                          (nn/make-binary-classifier-reporter)
                          (r/make-print-logger :space))
                  nn/logistic
                  ; The `:predicting` input is set to 1 (true) by default when we run `evaluate-model` below.
                  ; During training, it is set to 0 (false). When training, we compute cost. When predicting,
                  ; we apply a threshold.
                  (#(tensor-if :predicting
                               (> % 0.5)
                               (nn/binary-cross-entropy % (reshape :y [4 1]))))
                  (report (r/make-value-reporter "Cost") (r/make-print-logger :space))))
    :optimizer-options {:learning-rate 1
                        :report [:iteration]}))

(def trained-model (nn/train-model naive-model :xor 250))
;; Prints:
;;   Accuracy: 25.0%  Cost: 2.881609  Iteration: 1
;;   Accuracy: 50.0%  Cost: 2.810322  Iteration: 2

;;   Accuracy: 100.0%  Cost: 0.09574343  Iteration: 250

(nn/evaluate-model trained-model :xor)
;; => #Tensure
;;    [0,
;;     1.0000,
;;     1.0000,

```

## Examples

The [examples](https://github.com/cguenthner/neurojure/tree/master/src/examples) directory contains a couple
examples of using neurojure to solve more practical problems:

- [`mnist.clj`](https://github.com/cguenthner/neurojure/tree/master/src/examples/mnist.clj) - training a
  convolutional neural network to recognize handwritten digits
- [`book_reviews.clj`](https://github.com/cguenthner/neurojure/tree/master/src/examples/book_reviews.clj) -
  training a recurrent neural network to predict a user's rating of a book based on their written review
